:::{#hero-heading}

I'm an **[independent expert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophscheuch/)** in finance & data and provide services and trainings related to data infrastructure, data analysis, machine learning, and general data science topics.

Previously, I was the Head of AI, Director of Product, and Head of BI & Data Science at the social trading platform **[wikifolio.com](https://www.wikifolio.com?utm_source=christophscheuch.github.io)** 

I'm also co-creator and maintainer of the project **[Tidy Finance](https://www.tidy-finance.org?utm_source=christophscheuch.github.io)**.

I write about tidy data science with R, Python and Julia on my blog **[Tidy Intelligence](https://blog.tidy-intelligence.com/?utm_source=christophscheuch.github.io)**.

I occasionally design shirts and mugs that you can find under the **[Tidy Swag](https://www.etsy.com/shop/tidyswag/?etsrc=sdt&utm_source=christophscheuch.github.io)** brand.

I'm also co-organizing events of the **[Berlin R Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/berlin-r-users-group/)**.
